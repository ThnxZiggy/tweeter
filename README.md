# Considerations

This was my first endevouer with HTML/CSS/AJAX/jQuery. With more exposure it is my intentino to implement the following features;
- User registration/login and validation
- Implementing SASS
- Adding functionality to the 'Write a Tweet' to hide and display the input tweet field
- Linking this to a database and hosting this as its own production enviornment
- Implenting a count on the likes/shares/flagged icons
